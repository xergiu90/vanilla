# Instructions

I have tried to make this application as simple as possible just so I can show the ES6 skills used.

This app can be ran directly by clicking the index.html file or you can go to [node js site](https://sabe.io/tutorials/setting-up-local-web-server-node-js) 

There you will find the instructions to create a local node server:

1.  Run the following command in your local cli to make make sure you have npm install:

        npm install 
2.  Install the http-server by running `npm install http-server -g`
3.  Start your server with ` http-server -o` 
4.  You can enter either one of the addresses in the browser: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` or other shown in the cli

## Git project

You can find the git clone the project using this command:
`git clone https://github.com/xergiu90/vanilla.git`
